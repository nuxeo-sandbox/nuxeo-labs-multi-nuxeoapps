## Support
**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning
resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be
useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.

## About Nuxeo
Nuxeo Platform is an open source Content Services platform, written in Java. Data can be stored in both SQL & NoSQL
databases.

The development of the Nuxeo Platform is mostly done by Nuxeo employees with an open development model.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

Typically, Nuxeo users build different types of information management solutions
for [document management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/document-management/), [case management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/case-management/),
and [digital asset management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/dam-digital-asset-management/), use cases. It uses
schema-flexible metadata & content models that allows content to be repurposed to fulfill future use cases.
